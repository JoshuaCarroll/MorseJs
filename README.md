MorseJs - A javascript object to play Morse Code
================================================

There are many so-called "Morse Code translators" across the Internet. However most of them have the same flaw: Morse Code is not meant to be a written language, rather it is an audible language. This library or object or whatever you want to call it can be used to fill that gap. 

### Usage

Simply include the script on your web page, then execute the object in one of the methods shown here:

    MorseJs.Play(string TextToSend, [int SpeedInWordsPerMinute, int ToneFrequency]);             
    MorseJs.Play("cq cq de n5jlc k");                                                            
    MorseJs.Play("cq cq de n5jlc k", 25);                                                        
    MorseJs.Play("cq cq de n5jlc k", 25, 500); 

### Demo

You can see and play with a live demo on CodePen (which, next to IFTTT and Stack Overflow, very well could be th best site on the Internet. The URL is [https://codepen.io/JoshuaCarroll/pen/QgrdzL](https://codepen.io/JoshuaCarroll/pen/QgrdzL).
